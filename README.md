Shoutz0r - A media voting system perfect for events such as lan-parties!\
Comes with autoDJ to keep requests going when no requests have been added by users.

Shoutz0r gives users a platform to upload different kinds of media, and vote on what they would like to hear or watch (yes it supports videos too!).\
The queue can be generated based on the amount of votes, or as a regular queue (first come, first serve).

Built using the Laravel Framework and Vue components.

Documentation can be found over at [shoutzor.com](https://www.shoutzor.com)

### To setup:
When the app is deployed, just visit the site to start the setup process.\
The installer will guide you through it.

The Shoutz0r app should now be ready for use!

The default login is admin/admin

Optionally: for development run `php artisan db:seed --class=DevelopmentSeeder`
If you're going to work on the front-end, make sure to run `npm run watch`.
